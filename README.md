# CrossAES
###### *The Cross-Language AES-256 Encryption/Decryption Library*
CrossAES took me over 12 hours of digging to unearth a way to make the .NET's world play nice with mcrypt. Since it took me so long, I decided to bring it to light. I hope this helps someone.

#### Current Capabilities
##### Languages
* C#
* VB.Net
* PHP

##### Features

* CBC mode

#### *Planned*
##### Languages

#### Usage
##### VB
First, include crossaes.vb to your project. For an example on how to use CrossAES in VB, check the [VB Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/CNC65Q).

##### C#
First, include crossaes.cs to your project. For an example on how to use CrossAES in C#, check the [C# Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/fr8zz9).

##### PHP
First, include crossaes.php to your project or paste the contents in your PHP script. For an example on how to use CrossAES in PHP, check the [Codepad](http://codepad.org/tV5HnU8S). *Note: Codepad does not have the mcrypt extension, so it displays an error, but it is perfectly valid code tested on my own machine.*
